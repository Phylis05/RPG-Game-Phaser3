## About
- The main objective of this project was to build a platform game. I got inspiration from Zenva Academy Tutorial to implement the game design, different scenes and scoring system.
- Created game background design using tilesmap editor. The blocked layers and game objects such as the players, treasure box and monsters were added while designing on the map editor and the background image was exported in a json file.
- Got the initial game template setup from Zenva Academy. I then modified to add extra features to enhance the game.The game logic is made up of the following:
  - The player spawn at different locations of the gamescene as the game starts.
  - There are blocked layers so the player does not move freely in the tilemap or background just to increase the complexity.
  - The monsters and the treasure box spawn at different locations of the gamescene, just like the player does.
  - The player must collect the treasure box to get more gold.
  - The player gets more health and gold by fighting the monsters with his sword. The sword can be gotten by pressing the spacebar of your keyboard.
  - The player must be quick to fight the monsters so that he doesn't lose his/her health.
  - The game is over when the player's health is at zero.
- The leaderboard API is implemented to display players with highest scores.

## How to play:
- Use the left arrow key on the keyboard to move the player to the left of the game scene, the right arrow key to the right,the up arrow key to up and the down arrow key to down.
- Use the space bar key on the keyboard to fight the monsters with your weapon which is a sword. The player must collect the treasure box to get more gold.
- The player gets more health and gold by fighting the monsters with his sword. The sword can be gotten by pressing the space bar key on your keyboard.
- The player must be quick to fight the monsters so that he doesn't lose his health.
- The game is over if the player's health is at zero.
- When the game is over it takes you to screen where you can add your scores to the leader board, click on the submit button to add your name to the leader board.
